# Welcome to Intro to CSS!

During this session, we will...

-   Review selectors, check out the layout of Rails' CSS files
-   Define a flexbox
-   Make observations on the default behavior
-   Discuss the anatomy of a flexbox
    -   What is the relationship between a flexbox and the flex items?
    -   Why do justify and align change?
    -   What are you making rules for? The parent? The children?
-   Move stuff around inside of a flexbox
-   Define a grid
-   Move elements around the grid using various different CSS instructions
-   Think critically about how to debug a CSS problem
    -   Testing items in the console *before* you code them into the app
-   Reflect upon the nuanced changes to the human experience, from the invention of simple tools to combat the frustration of a hunter or gatherer, to yourself, repeatedly typing `border: 1px solid red;` to combat the frustration of the intangible reality of computer programming. Are our fears the same?
